# Bee Cycles Market Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Insights Dashboard
Bee Cycles Market: Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Insights Dashboard Using Power BI is an analytics dashboard designed to help businesses understand customer behavior patterns and market segmentation based on transaction data and customer interactions (consist about Bee Cycles).

# Objective Analysis
Since I want to increase revenue, I aim to identify the most potential customers based on region, product category, and purchasing trends. Then, I will analyze which products sell best in specific regions and identify customer segmentation for each product while optimizing total costs (unit price + shipping) to improve profit margins per transaction.

<h3> Approach Method : Customer Segmentation - Base Demography </h3>
